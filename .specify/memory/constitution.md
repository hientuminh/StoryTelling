# Storytelling App Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Child Safety & Content Integrity

**MUST** ensure all content is appropriate for children (age 3-12)

Content safety requirements:
- All stories MUST pass content validation before publication
- User-generated content (if implemented) MUST be moderated before display
- No external links or advertisements in story content
- Age-appropriate language and themes enforced at API and UI levels
- Content moderation logs MUST be maintained for audit purposes

**Rationale**: The primary users are children. Safety is non-negotiable and supersedes feature velocity. Every feature involving content display or storage must include safety validation.

### II. User-Centric Design

**MUST** prioritize intuitive, child-friendly user experience

UX requirements:
- Large, touch-friendly UI elements (minimum 44x44px touch targets)
- Clear visual feedback for all interactions
- Simple navigation with minimal cognitive load
- Support for both Vietnamese and visual/audio content
- Accessibility features (high contrast, screen reader support where applicable)
- Loading states and error messages must be child-appropriate

**Rationale**: Children have different motor skills and cognitive capabilities than adults. Interfaces must be designed specifically for the target age group to ensure engagement and learning effectiveness.

### III. Test-First Development

**MUST** follow test-driven development for all feature work

Testing requirements:
- Tests written BEFORE implementation (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- User approval of test scenarios before implementation begins
- Contract tests for all API endpoints
- Integration tests for critical user journeys
- Tests must fail initially, then pass after implementation
- Minimum test coverage targets defined per feature

**Rationale**: Child-facing applications require high reliability. TDD ensures features work as specified and prevents regressions that could impact user experience or safety.

### IV. Modular Architecture

**MUST** maintain clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend

Architecture requirements:
- Frontend (Next.js) communicates with backend ONLY via REST API
- Backend (NestJS) provides versioned REST API with clear contracts
- Shared types defined in contracts and maintained between both codebases
- Each module/feature should be independently testable
- Database access ONLY through backend services, never direct from frontend
- API versioning strategy (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format)

**Rationale**: Separation enables independent development, testing, and scaling of frontend and backend. Clear contracts prevent integration issues and support future platform expansion (mobile apps).

### V. Observability & Maintainability

**MUST** implement structured logging and monitoring for production readiness

Observability requirements:
- Structured logging with appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Request/response logging at API boundaries
- Error tracking with context (user action, timestamp, stack trace)
- Performance monitoring for story loading times
- Database query performance monitoring
- Health check endpoints for both frontend and backend

**Rationale**: Production issues in child-facing apps must be identified and resolved quickly. Comprehensive logging enables rapid debugging and ensures system reliability.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality

- TypeScript strict mode MUST be enabled in both frontend and backend
- ESLint rules enforced in CI/CD pipeline
- No direct type assertions (`as Type`) without justification
- Meaningful variable and function names (prefer clarity over brevity)
- Comments required for complex business logic, especially content validation rules

### API Design

- RESTful conventions followed consistently
- API responses use standard HTTP status codes
- Error responses include user-friendly messages (child-appropriate when applicable)
- Pagination required for list endpoints (stories, categories)
- Input validation at API boundary with clear error messages

### Database

- Migration-based schema management
- No direct SQL in business logic (use ORM/query builder)
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Soft deletes for content (preserve for audit trail)

## Compliance & Review

### Constitutional Compliance

- All features MUST align with core principles before approval
- Pull requests MUST include testing evidence (test results, coverage reports)
- Architecture decisions that deviate from Principle IV require justification and approval
- Content moderation features (Principle I) cannot be skipped or deferred

### Amendment Process

- Amendments require documentation of rationale and impact analysis
- Version bump follows semantic versioning:
  - **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible principle changes or removals
  - **MINOR**: New principles added or material expansions
  - **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording fixes, non-semantic changes
- All templates must be updated to reflect constitutional changes

### Complexity Justification

- Introducing additional services/projects beyond frontend + backend requires justification
- New dependencies (frameworks, libraries) must be justified against existing alternatives
- Architectural complexity must provide clear benefit for child user experience or safety
